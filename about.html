            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>My name is Cameron Hall. I am a second year student at Michigan State University studying my passion - film production. When I was a child, I was 
                fascinated by the magic in films like Star Wars and Harry Potter. I vowed that, someday, I would make movies. Since then, that has been my goal. I now 
                write, film, edit, and produce short films, and I have much prepared for the future. However, there is much more to me. I am also a fan of European football 
                (soccer), and I am a huge fan of Liverpool (England), Juventus (Italy), Real Oveido (Spain), and Tokyo Verdy (Japan). I played the sport for 15 years, and it 
                became my life. With this, I have a passion for fitness, and I love learning about and studying the muscular system of humans to better understand how
                the body responds to working out. As for music, I spent a year or two playing the baritone, but found my footing in percussion, specializing in the marimba
                and the timpani. About two years ago, I delved into vocals and actually was Davey (a main role) in a production of Newsies. Before this production, I spent
                most of my theatre days in the tech booth as the student head of sound. It was here that I found my passion for sound technology that takes a part in how
                I create and edit films today. At the end of the day, I am working to become the best filmmaker I can be and use my many passions as a source of inspiration
                as I create my journey forward.</p>
